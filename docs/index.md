# FrozenFigma Documentation

This folder contains project documentation for development, testing, and architecture.

## Key Documents

- [Architecture & Technical Plan](./architecture.md) — the project's architecture, data model, and agent loop (moved from the repo root PLANNING.md).
- [Development / Testing](./dev/testing.md) — testing philosophy, practices, and the "no mocks" guideline.
- [Development / Logging](./dev/logging.md) — logging & diagnostics guidance for agent turns, artifacts, and checkpoints.
- [Theme Documentation](./theme-documentation.md) — design tokens and theme notes.

## Notes

- This is a personal project with agent assistance. The docs are written to prioritize robust CI, traceability, and agent-friendly validation. If you want other docs added (e.g., CI internals, deployment notes, visual regression), tell me where and I'll add them.
