- [Development / Testing](./dev/testing.md) — testing philosophy, practices, and the "no mocks" guideline.
- [Development / Logging](./dev/logging.md) — logging & diagnostics guidance for agent turns, artifacts, and checkpoints.
- [Theme Documentation](./theme-documentation.md) — design tokens and theme notes.
- [Technical Debt & Known Issues](./dev/technical-debt.md) — current status and tracking of TS/ESLint issues.
- [CI & Test Results](./dev/ci-test-results.md) — CI run notes and recommendations.
- [Status Snapshot (2025-10-07)](./status10-7.md) — signed codebase snapshot and summary.

## Notes

- This is a personal project with agent assistance. The docs are written to prioritize robust CI, traceability, and agent-friendly validation. If you want other docs added (e.g., CI internals, deployment notes, visual regression), tell me where and I'll add them.
