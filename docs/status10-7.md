Overview

This document captures the current state of the repository at the time of this snapshot. It is intended as a short, practical status for personal/agent-assisted development and CI auditing.

Repository
- Repo: FrozenFigma
- Owner: Coldaine
- Current branch: main
- Default branch: master

High-level summary

- Agent loop implemented: `src/agent/index.ts` orchestrates Intent → Plan → Patch → Validate → (Repair) → Result flow.
- Validation gates present: repo scripts include `lint`, `types`, `test`, `smoke` and `gate` (which runs the whole pipeline). See `package.json` scripts.
- Tests: Vitest-based tests exist under `src/tests/` (unit + theme/token tests + skeletons + repair tests + smoke tests). The project favors live/integration-style tests per the documented philosophy.
- CI: A GitHub Actions workflow was added at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run the validation gate and build on pushes and pull requests (Node matrix 18.x/20.x).
- Docs: `docs/` now contains:
  - `docs/index.md` — index for docs
  - `docs/architecture.md` — moved/renamed from the original planning content
  - `docs/dev/testing.md` — updated with testing philosophy ("no mocks") and future-state vision
  - `docs/dev/logging.md` — updated with logging guidance and future-state vision
  - `docs/theme-documentation.md` — existing theme docs

Quality gates & reliability

- Lint: ESLint + Prettier scripts exist; CI runs lint as part of `npm run gate`.
- Types: `tsc --noEmit` script exists and is part of the gate.
- Tests: `vitest run` is used for unit/integration; `vitest run tests/smoke.test.tsx` for smoke tests.
- Atomicity & Repair: The codebase includes repair tooling and transaction/rollback semantics referenced by the agent.

Files added/modified in this snapshot
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — CI workflow to run the validation gate and build on push/PR.
- `docs/index.md` — docs index linking architecture, testing, logging.
- `docs/architecture.md` — architecture & technical plan (moved into docs).
- `docs/dev/testing.md` — updated with "no mocks" philosophy and future-state vision.
- `docs/dev/logging.md` — updated with logging guidance and future-state vision.

Open items / Known gaps

- Pre-commit hooks: No Husky / lint-staged pre-commit hooks were present prior to this snapshot. I recommend adding Husky + lint-staged to run ESLint and a quick smoke test on staged files locally.
- Coverage reporting: Coverage artifacts upload step is present in CI (artifact upload), but no enforced coverage thresholds or reporting dashboard are configured.
- Visual regression / E2E: Not present yet; plan to add Playwright / visual-regression once headless start scripts and baseline artifacts are in place.
- Docs linting: `docs/architecture.md` has a few markdown lint warnings (fenced code language, blank lines) that should be cleaned for consistency. They do not affect functionality.
- Root planning file: the original `PLANNING.md` at the repo root has been incorporated into `docs/architecture.md`. There is no separate top-level `PLANNING.md` now.

Status by acceptance criteria (AC-1..AC-6)
- AC-1 (Settings menu): Not explicitly verified in this snapshot. Component skeletons and skeleton tests exist; manual or automated smoke runs will confirm visual/interaction behavior.
- AC-2 (Tabs): Skeletons and tests reference tabs; implementational details present but needs validation by smoke/E2E.
- AC-3 (Modal): Skeletons and planner include modal patterns; needs smoke validation.
- AC-4 (Style change / diff logs): Artifact & logging functionality is planned and partially present; per-turn diffs are logged by reporter components in `src/agent/reporter` (implementations may vary).
- AC-5 (Save & Load): Persistence modules exist under `src/io/persistence` but require runtime verification for full fidelity.
- AC-6 (Gate & Repair Loop): Gate scripts exist and the agent repair loop is implemented in code; tests for repair exist under `src/tests/repair.test.ts`.

Recommendations / Next steps
1. Fix the minor markdown lint issues in `docs/architecture.md` for clarity and consistency.
2. Add Husky + lint-staged pre-commit hooks to enforce linting and fast checks locally before push.
3. Configure optional coverage thresholds and a reporting step (codecov / upload to artifacts) if you want enforced coverage.
4. Add an E2E job (Playwright) and visual-diff baselines in CI when you add a reproducible headless start command.
5. Wire artifact uploads in the CI reporter to include per-turn screenshots/diffs for PR inspection.

This snapshot was created to give you a concise, auditable status for personal review or for agents to reference when making changes.
